## JUnit Automation Exercises

### Project Overview

This project provides a collection of automated JUnit test cases designed to exercise various programming concepts and algorithms.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository:

```git clone https://github.com/your-username/junit-automation-exercises.git ```

2. Set Up Environment:
  - Ensure you have Java and JUnit installed.
  - Configure your IDE or build tool to recognize the project.

3. Run Tests:
  - Use your IDE's built-in test runner or execute the test task in your Gradle/Maven build script.

### Technologies Used

- Java
- JUnit

### Chosen algoritms

- **Palindromes**: Validates strings for palindromic properties.
- **Fibonacci Numbers**: Tests the calculation and verification of the Fibonacci sequence.
- _in progress_
  
### Test Coverages

The project provides extensive test coverage for the following areas:

- Correctness: Verifies that the implemented algorithms and functions produce accurate results.
- Edge Cases: Tests various edge cases, such as empty strings, null values, and special characters.
- Error Handling: Ensures that the code handles exceptions and errors gracefully.

### Future work

- Add more test cases to cover additional scenarios and edge cases.
- Evaluate the performance of algorithms, especially for time-sensitive operations.
- Experiment with other testing frameworks like TestNG or Spock for comparison
